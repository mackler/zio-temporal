# Next Steps

If you have followed the tutorial along to this conclusion then congratulations on your achievement!  We have only just hinted at the full possibilities available by using ZIO-Temporal, but already you know how to create a durable Workflow that communicates with outside services.  But there is much more to know.  Here are some important topics you can focus on next:

* Testing Workflows using [ZTestWorkflowEnvironment](https://zio-temporal.vhonta.dev/docs/testing/testing-workflows) and [ZIO-Test](https://zio.dev/reference/test/)
* [Querying Workflow Executions](https://zio-temporal.vhonta.dev/docs/workflows/queries)
* [Sending signals to Workflow Executions](https://zio-temporal.vhonta.dev/docs/workflows/signals)
* [Packaging your program into a container image for deployment](https://www.scala-sbt.org/sbt-native-packager/formats/docker.html)
* [Handling errors](https://zio.dev/reference/error-management/)

The source code for the example programs in this tutorial are available in a single repository [on GitHub](https://github.com/mackler/zio-temporal-tutorial).
