# Next Steps

If you have followed along with the tutorial to the end congratulations on your achievement.  We have only just hinted at the full possibilities available by using ZIO-Temporal, but already you know how to create a durable Workflow that communicates with outside services.  But there is much more to know.  Here are some important topics you can focus on next:

* [Unit-testing Workflows Definitions](https://github.com/mackler/zio-temporal-tutorial)
* [Querying Workflow Executions](https://docs.temporal.io/develop/java/message-passing#queries)
* [Sending signals to Workflow Executions](https://docs.temporal.io/develop/java/message-passing#signals)
* [Packaging your program into a container image](https://www.scala-sbt.org/sbt-native-packager/formats/docker.html)

The source code for the example programs in this tutorial are available in a single repository [on GitHub](https://github.com/mackler/zio-temporal-tutorial).
